# join:
# "-a 1" print lines from file1 (eae) with runID that are not in file2 (aes)
# "-t $'\t'" specifies the input and output file field separator (default is ' '
# "-1 2 -2 1" join on field 2 in file1 and field 1 in file2
# "-o 1.1,1.2,1.3,2.2"  the format of the output line e.g. 1.1 is field 1 from
#   file1 and 2.2 is field 2 from file 2
#
# each file is sorted and redirected into join - note that the sort syntax  and 
#   $'\t' only works in bash

# sort:
# "-k 2" sort on column 2
